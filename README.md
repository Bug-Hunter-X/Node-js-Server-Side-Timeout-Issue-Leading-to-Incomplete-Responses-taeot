# Node.js Server-Side Timeout Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers where long-running requests can lead to incomplete responses due to timeouts. The server simulates a 5-second delay before sending a response. If the client's timeout is shorter than 5 seconds, the connection is closed before the response is received, resulting in an incomplete response.

## Problem

The primary problem lies in the server's handling of long-running requests. When a request takes longer to process than the client or server's timeout setting, the connection is prematurely terminated, resulting in an incomplete response and potential errors on the client-side. 

## Solution

The solution involves adjusting server settings to accommodate longer request processing times or implementing techniques to manage timeouts effectively on both client and server sides. This can include: 

* **Increasing keep-alive timeout:** Modify the server to increase the keep-alive timeout, providing more time for long-running tasks to complete.  
* **Implementing request timeouts:** Add mechanisms to terminate requests that exceed a specific timeout value, thus preventing indefinite delays and potential server resource exhaustion.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Utilize asynchronous programming techniques to prevent blocking operations and ensure efficient response times. 
* **Progress updates:** Consider providing regular progress updates to the client to inform about the request status and reduce timeout-related issues.

This repo contains example code showcasing the problem and its solution.
